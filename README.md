# Labirint_server_project
1) This is my labirint server project. This is my second MIPT project, which can make everything that can make 1-st labirint project + network gameplay connection
2) I have two .py files: server file (server.py) and client (gamer) file (gamer.py).
3) You have to run server.py to run server, than you have to run gamer.py to run the game. Game seems like usual labirint-search multiplayer game for two computers. You can start it from one computer and play with yourself, enjoing the work of the server. Actually, you can run  gamer.py from two computers, and play classic multiplayer game.
4) Enjoying the game starts with small debugging the server.py and gamer.py code in case of changing IP address to your ip address for clear connection between server and client sockets.
